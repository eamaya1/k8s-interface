## Personal Project: Kubernetes Resource Dashboard

The goal of this project is to continue to familiarize myself with Go. To do this my objective is simple:

Build a Go application that connects to a Kubernetes cluster and displays live resource usage â€” pods, deployments, services, etc. filtered by namespace. 

This will be rendered in a terminal UI. Maybe bubbletea?

Key Features:
A terminal which allows you to filter by namespace and retrieve the following resources
 - Pods
 - Services
 - Deployments
 - Nodes (?)
